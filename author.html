	<h1>J.R.R Tolkien</h1>

<div id="paragraph1">
<h2>Early Life & Family</h2>
<p class="mainPara">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, on January 3, 1892, to Arthur Tolkien and Mabel Suffield Tolkien.
After Arthur Tolkien died from complications of rheumatic fever, Mabel settled with four-year-old J.R.R. (then called Ronald) and his
younger brother, Hilary, in the country hamlet of Sarehole, in Birmingham, England. Mabel Tolkien died in 1904, and the Tolkien brothers
were sent to live with a relative and in boarding homes, with a Catholic priest assuming guardianship in Birmingham. J.R.R. went on to get
 his first-class degree at Exeter College, specializing in Anglo-Saxon and Germanic languages and classic literature. </p>

<div id="paragraph2">
<h2>World War 1</h2>
<p class="mainPara">Tolkien enlisted as a lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers and served in World War I, making sure to continue writing as well.
 He fought in the Battle of the Somme, in which there were severe casualties, and was eventually released from duty due to illness.
 In the midst of his military service, he’d married Edith Bratt in 1916.
Continuing his linguistic studies, Tolkien joined the faculty of the University of Leeds in 1920 and a few years later became a professor
 at Oxford University. While there he started a writing group called The Inklings, which counted among its members C.S. Lewis and
 Owen Barfield. It was also at Oxford, while grading a paper, that he spontaneously wrote a short line about "a hobbit."</p>

<div id="paragraph3">
<h2>Books</h2>
<p class="mainPara">The award-winning fantasy novel The Hobbit — about the small, furry-footed Bilbo Baggins and his adventures — was published in 1937 and
 was regarded as a children’s book, though Tolkien would state the book wasn’t originally intended for children.
 He also created more than 100 drawings to support the narrative.
 <br><br>
 Over the years, while working on scholarly publications, Tolkien developed the work that would come to be regarded as his masterpiece.
 The Lord of the Rings series, partially inspired by ancient European myths, with its own sets of maps, lore and languages.
 Tolkien released part one of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring, in 1954; The Two Towers and The Return of the King followed in 1955,
 finishing up the trilogy. The books gave readers a rich literary trove populated by elves, goblins, talking trees and all manner of fantastic
 creatures, including characters like the wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Gimli.
